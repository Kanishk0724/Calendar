# Calendar <br>
I've enhanced the calendar app by adding a to-do list and events functionality. This will allow users to add events to specific dates and maintain a to-do list alongside the calendar. <br>
**1. To-Do List Section:** <br>
-Add, complete, and delete tasks <br>
-Tasks persist using localStorage <br>
-Visual indication for completed tasks (strikethrough) <br>
-Independent from calendar dates - tasks are general <br>
**2. Events System:** <br>
-Click on any date to select it <br>
-Add events specific to selected dates <br>
-Events show time they were created <br>
-Visual indicator (small dot) on calendar for dates with events <br>
-Events persist using localStorage <br>
**3. Improved UI/UX:** <br>
-Two-panel layout with calendar on the left, to-dos and events on the right <br>
-Clear section headers <br>
-Selected date display <br>
-Responsive design that works on different screen sizes <br>
**4. Data Persistence:** <br>
-All events and to-do items are saved to localStorage <br>
-Data persists even after closing the browser <br>

The app maintains Kanishk's credit in the footer and keeps the clean, modern design of the original calendar.
